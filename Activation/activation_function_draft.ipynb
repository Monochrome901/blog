    "<p>Activation functions define the output of the neurons for a set of inputs. In a broader sense, activation functions prevent linearity i.e. if we take a linear activation function, we end up with an output, which is a linear function irrespective of whether our data is linear or not linear.</p>\n",
    "<p><img src=\"blog1.jpg\" width=\"400 height=\"300\" align=\"left\">To introduce non-linearity in our dataset we use activation functions. For peeps more interested in the technicalities, activation functions counter the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients which arise as a result of the deeper networks where the value of derivative terms is usually less than 1. When we multiply the derivative terms successively, the gradient becomes smaller and eventually vanishes. Otherwise, when the derivative terms are greater than 1, their multiplication leads to gradients that tend to infinity. Activation functions counter this problem by limiting the value of the gradients. Such results can be achieved with the help of different mathematical functions, used for neural network computing.</p> "

Further, the functions are only really sensitive to changes around their mid-point of their input, such as 0.5 for sigmoid and 0.0 for tanh. ReLU adds more sensitivity to weighted sum and thus this avoids neurons from getting saturated (i.e when there is little or no variation in the output). \n",
